# Blockchain-Practice
A record of what I learned from Youtube and Udemy.
Coding as well as general info about blockchain. Especially cryptos and NFTs.

<2/14 - 2/20> </br>
- Udemy: The Complete NFT Course </br>
www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nft-course-learn-everything-about-nfts </br>
Very brief introduction to NFTs how how to buy & sell on marketplaces and use third party websites to create and launch your own NFT. </br>
Wasn't really what I was looking for because I wanted to learn the coding aspect of it. Also, the amount of info provided was pretty shallow. Mostly stuff I could
learn on YouTube. </br>

- YouTube: Intro to Solidity Programming Language - Ethereum Blockchain Developer Tutorial for Beginners </br>

Dapp University seems to be in line with what I'm trying to learn right now. I watched couple of his longer YouTube tutorials before and they were very informational. </br>
This video seems to be his easiest video so it seemed to be a perfect place to start learning to code NFT. </br>
Worked on a very high-level smart contract that simply Reads/sets string value. Worked on remix. </br>

- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>

Just trying out Linkedin Learning since they offer one month free trial. The contents seem to be better than Udemy.
