# Blockchain-Practice
Keeping a record of what I learned from Youtube, Udemy, Linkedin Learning, Coursera, etc.
Coding as well as general info about blockchain. Especially cryptos and NFTs.

------------------------------------------------------

<2021> </br>

Record of some of the channels I really liked: </br>
Whteboard Crypto: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteboardCrypto (easier to watch for beginners, watched most of the vids) </br>
Finematics: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1ob28ceGdqohUnR7vBACA (solid all around, learned a lot of defi related stuff here, watched most of the vids) </br>
99Bitcoins: https://www.youtube.com/c/Bitcoinwithpaypal/featured (more detailed than Whiteboard, watched like half of cryto related vids) </br>
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx7YSpyYtgaYik1Wen9jYSA (best easy-to-understand visual demonstration on how blockchain works) </br>
Lex Fridman: https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman (watched blockchain related interviews) </br>
Robert Breedlove: https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertBreedlove22 (good shtuff, learned a ton from him) </br>
GoldSilver: https://www.youtube.com/c/Goldsilver (not blockchain related but their Hidden Secrets of Money series helped me understand why Bitcoin is so important) </br>
신박한 신박사: https://www.youtube.com/c/%EC%8B%A0%EB%B0%95%ED%95%9C%EC%8B%A0%EB%B0%95%EC%82%AC (got to know and hear from many big names in crypto and Bitcoin maximalists like Michael Saylor, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Robert Breedlove, Jimmy Song, etc. Mostly clips from their interviews in which they emphasize the importance of decentralization and potential of blockchain and cryptos) </br>
지혜의 족보: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGUaygjUeV-Zm_DRuFS0pA (one of the first Bitcoin maximalists in South Korea)
Miss Defi: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnrXcnEYG4ea2UBGq4WEkDA/featured (different types of wallets, how to use dapps, ways you can make money with dapps like yield farming, etc.) </br>
 </br>
 
Other than watching videos, I played around with Dapps like Compound Finance, Uniswap, PoolTogether, etc. because gas fees were way lower back then </br>

<2/14 - 2/20> </br>
- Udemy: The Complete NFT Course </br>
www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nft-course-learn-everything-about-nfts </br>
Very brief introduction to NFTs how how to buy & sell on marketplaces and use third party websites to create and launch your own NFT. </br>
Wasn't really what I was looking for because I wanted to learn the coding aspect of it. Also, the amount of info provided was pretty shallow. Mostly stuff I could
learn on YouTube. </br>

- YouTube: Intro to Solidity Programming Language - Ethereum Blockchain Developer Tutorial for Beginners </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSmc7Hto2k&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgUq-aMMYeKf8nPqHrNqa3Iu&index=1&ab_channel=DappUniversity </br>
Dapp University seems to be in line with what I'm trying to learn right now. I watched couple of his longer YouTube tutorials before and they were very informational. </br>
This video seems to be his easiest video so it seemed to be a perfect place to start learning to code NFT. </br>
Worked on a very high-level smart contract that simply Reads/sets string value. Worked on remix. </br>
- Youtube: Solidity for Beginners - Smart Contract Developer Tutorial #2 </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO62lD_Ulys&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgUq-aMMYeKf8nPqHrNqa3Iu&index=2&ab_channel=DappUniversity </br>
variable types </br>
public declaration </br>
constant </br>
enum </br>

Couldn't do much because of midterms and school projects...

- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/blockchain-basics-14414119/the-future-of-blockchain-innovation?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false </br>
Good recap of what blockchain is. I liked the last two parts in which the instructor talks about how blockchain can be used in diverse industries (voting system like Rock n Roll hall of fame bot attack example, supply chain, finance, etc) and blockchain's main challenges (regulatory uncertainty, lack of user trust, scalability, etc.). </br>
Pretty short course with just over one hour of vids, finished today. </br>
Just trying out Linkedin Learning since they offer one month free trial. The contents seem to be better than Udemy. </br>
-Linkedin: Become a Blockchain Developer </br>
Finished section 1 and half of section 2. Both sections are mostly high level overview of blockchain and gets into more details about Ethereum. </br>

------------------------------------------------------

<3/12> </br>
- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
Finished section 2 and section 3. Section 3 is more in-depth info about Ethereum and setup for coding. </br>

------------------------------------------------------
<~3/28> </br>
- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
Finished up to section 7, building basic supply chain dapp. </br>
Got to learn about coding based on ERC20. </br>
event-driven programming, publish and subscribe model. </br>

<4/12> </br>
- Came back from Bitcoin Conference in Miami. </br>
- Looks like apps with lightening network really will come into our daily lives very soon so that we will be getting goods and services with btc. </br>
- Bicoin has been criticized heavily for not being a good medium of exchange, but not anymore. </br>
- I'll try to reread Mastering Bitcoin and then read Matering the Lightning Network. </br>

------------------------------------------------------

<5/24> </br>
- Been a really long time since I updated because of finals, papers, family coming over for graduation, trip after graduation, and whole lotta other excuses. </br>
- My LinkedIn trial is over, so no longer using it (felt like not all lessons there were straight-forward & informative, think it's better to compare and buy individual lessons somewhere else) </br>
- Read Mastering Bitcoin and some Bitcoin books I found at Emory library like The Book of Satoshi, The Bitcoin Standard, and forgot the names. </br>
- I tried to follow along the C++ code which I have no experience in, but eventually decided to stick to Ethereum stuff first than Bitcoin because solidity is easier to learn for JavaScript users. </br>
- Finished Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide course on Udemy and redoing some of the stuff I learned there right now (different repo's). </br>
- Should review React and NodeJS too because I have not used them for a while. Reviewing them will help me create practice projects using smart contracts too.
