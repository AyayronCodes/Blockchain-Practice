# NFT-Practices
A record of what I learned from Youtube and Udemy.

<2/14 - 2/20>
Udemy: The Complete NFT Course
www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nft-course-learn-everything-about-nfts
"Very brief introduction to NFTs how how to buy & sell on marketplaces and use third party websites to create and launch your own NFT.
Wasn't really what I was looking for because I wanted to learn the coding aspect of it. Also, the amount of info provided was pretty shallow. Mostly stuff I could
learn on YouTube."

YouTube: Intro to Solidity Programming Language - Ethereum Blockchain Developer Tutorial for Beginners
"Dapp University seems to be in line with what I'm trying to learn right now. I watched couple of his longer YouTube tutorials before and they were very informational.
This video seems to be his easiest video so it seemed to be a perfect place to start learning to code NFT.
Worked on a very high-level smart contract that simply Reads/sets string value. Worked on remix."
