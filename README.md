# Blockchain-Practice
Keeping a record of what I learned from Youtube, Linkedin Learning, Udemy, etc.
Coding as well as general info about blockchain. Especially cryptos and NFTs.

------------------------------------------------------

<2021> </br>
Just watched videos about blockchain mostly, never tried learning to code and implement it since I was mostly working on web dev.</br></br>
Some of the channels I really liked are: </br>
Whteboard Crypto: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteboardCrypto (easier to watch for beginners, watched most of the vids) </br>
Finematics: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1ob28ceGdqohUnR7vBACA (solid all around, learned a lot of defi related stuff here, watched most of the vids) </br>
99Bitcoins: https://www.youtube.com/c/Bitcoinwithpaypal/featured (more detailed than Whiteboard, watched like half of cryto related vids) </br>
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx7YSpyYtgaYik1Wen9jYSA (best easy-to-understand visual demonstration on how blockchain works) </br>
Lex Fridman: https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman (watched blockchain related interviews) </br>
Robert Breedlove: https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertBreedlove22 (good shtuff, learned a ton from him) </br>
GoldSilver: https://www.youtube.com/c/Goldsilver (not blockchain related but their Hidden Secrets of Money series helped me understand why Bitcoin is so important) </br>
신박한 신박사: https://www.youtube.com/c/%EC%8B%A0%EB%B0%95%ED%95%9C%EC%8B%A0%EB%B0%95%EC%82%AC (got to know and hear from many big names in crypto and Bitcoin maximalists like Michael Saylor, Jack Mallers, Jack Dorsey, Robert Breedlove, Jimmy Song, etc. Mostly clips from their interviews in which they emphasize the importance of decentralization and potential of blockchain and cryptos) </br>
지혜의 족보: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGUaygjUeV-Zm_DRuFS0pA (one of the first Bitcoin maximalists in South Korea)
Miss Defi: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnrXcnEYG4ea2UBGq4WEkDA/featured (different types of wallets, how to use dapps, ways you can make money with dapps like yield farming, etc.) </br>
 </br>
 
Other than watching videos, I played around with Dapps like Compound Finance, Uniswap, PoolTogether, etc. because gas fees were way lower back then </br>

<2/14 - 2/20> </br>
- Udemy: The Complete NFT Course </br>
www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nft-course-learn-everything-about-nfts </br>
Very brief introduction to NFTs how how to buy & sell on marketplaces and use third party websites to create and launch your own NFT. </br>
Wasn't really what I was looking for because I wanted to learn the coding aspect of it. Also, the amount of info provided was pretty shallow. Mostly stuff I could
learn on YouTube. </br>

- YouTube: Intro to Solidity Programming Language - Ethereum Blockchain Developer Tutorial for Beginners </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSmc7Hto2k&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgUq-aMMYeKf8nPqHrNqa3Iu&index=1&ab_channel=DappUniversity </br>
Dapp University seems to be in line with what I'm trying to learn right now. I watched couple of his longer YouTube tutorials before and they were very informational. </br>
This video seems to be his easiest video so it seemed to be a perfect place to start learning to code NFT. </br>
Worked on a very high-level smart contract that simply Reads/sets string value. Worked on remix. </br>
- Youtube: Solidity for Beginners - Smart Contract Developer Tutorial #2 </br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO62lD_Ulys&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgUq-aMMYeKf8nPqHrNqa3Iu&index=2&ab_channel=DappUniversity </br>
variable types </br>
public declaration </br>
constant </br>
enum </br>

Couldn't do much because of midterms and school projects...

- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/blockchain-basics-14414119/the-future-of-blockchain-innovation?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false </br>
Good recap of what blockchain is. I liked the last two parts in which the instructor talks about how blockchain can be used in diverse industries (voting system like Rock n Roll hall of fame bot attack example, supply chain, finance, etc) and blockchain's main challenges (regulatory uncertainty, lack of user trust, scalability, etc.). </br>
Pretty short course with just over one hour of vids, finished today. </br>
Just trying out Linkedin Learning since they offer one month free trial. The contents seem to be better than Udemy. </br>
-Linkedin: Become a Blockchain Developer </br>
Finished section 1 and half of section 2. Both sections are mostly high level overview of blockchain and gets into more details about Ethereum. </br>

------------------------------------------------------

<3/12> </br>
- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
Finished section 2 and section 3. Section 3 is more in-depth info about Ethereum and setup for coding. </br>

------------------------------------------------------
<~3/28> </br>
- Linkedin: Blockchain Basics </br>
Finished up to section 7, building basic supply chain dapp

<Interesting points/qustions to look into>
- Blockchain vs. AI: blockchain brings decentralization, but AI brings more "centralization"? With improved AI technology, powerful organizations & companies like big tech can get even more powerful. Conversely, blockchain technology could potentially restrain those them from gaining more control of society and keep them in check. </br>
- One of the main opposition to Bitcoin is that it uses too much electricity and hence it destroys our environment. Media saying that it uses up as much electricity as entire nation of Argentina does or sth. However, is that really true? A lot of electricity goes to "waste", especially during night time when electricity usage is way less times when people are awake and working. Since we can't store all the excess electricity, some places even experience difficulty trying to get rid of it. Look more into the reasons why Bitcoin is not really causing much environmental damage.
- When Ethereum switches over to POS, should it still be considered decentralized? Ethereum already had past issues that impacted its decentralization aspect of it with the foundation kicking in to "reverse" the malicious transactions with fork which never happens to Bitcoin with its creator, Satoshi, pretty much completely out of the picture. Is Ethereum Foudation a hindrance to Ethereum's decentralization? Now, switching over to POS this year could mean that ppl with more eth gain more power since their chances of getting to mine is obviously higher.
